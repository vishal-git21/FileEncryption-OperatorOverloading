In the world of computer science, encryption is a fundamental technique for securing data. By transforming readable data into an unreadable format, encryption ensures that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access. This project demonstrates a simple file encryption and decryption system using operator overloading in C++. By applying a Caesar cipher, the content of a file is shifted by a certain number of characters, making it unreadable. The system then reverses the process, restoring the original content and verifying the integrity of the encryption and decryption operations.
